# Boris' Toolkit for Java

### Although usable, this version in the `main` repository is outdated. I am migrating the toolkit to argument based, and I recommend you to check out the new branch created for it, it's called `experimental-arguments`

#### My first project on Java, and it is simple as that c:

#### Contains 3 functions
- Delete App from Launchpad Database
- Reset Launchpad Layout
- Enable/Disable Showing Desktop Icons

#### Use explicit options input
e.g. yes/no only contains either `yes` or `no` as options, or it will exit the application
