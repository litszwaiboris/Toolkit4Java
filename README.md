# Boris' Toolkit for Java

#### My first project on Java, and it is simple as that c:

#### Don't expect this is a professional software, as it is a personal testing project for me to learn more about Java, and its functionality will change greatly over time

#### New version, same functions, but instead utilize GUI instead of being TUI-based

#### Contains 3 functions
- Delete App from Launchpad Database
- Reset Launchpad Layout
- Enable/Disable Showing Desktop Icons
