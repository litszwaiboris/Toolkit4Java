# Boris' Toolkit for Java

#### My first project on Java, and it is simple as that c:

#### New version, same functions, but instead utilize arguments instead of being cli-based

#### Contains 3 functions
- Delete App from Launchpad Database
- Reset Launchpad Layout
- Enable/Disable Showing Desktop Icons

#### Use explicit options input
e.g. yes/no only contains either `yes` or `no` as options, or it will exit the application
